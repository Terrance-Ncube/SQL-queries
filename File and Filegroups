what are filegroups?

Filegroups are a logical construct used to separate tables and indexes from each other, files are the physical construct used to store information (log and data) about the database.

There are two files, one for data and one for the log.

	The Data files contain data, and objects such as tables, indexes,
	   stored procs, and views.
	The Log files contain information that is required to recover all transactions
	   in the database.
	 
	Data files can be grouped together in filegroups for allocation and 
	administration purposes.
	
	
	
DATABASE FILES - 3 TYPES

Primary
	Contains startup information for the DB and points to the other files
	in the DB. Every DB has one primary data file with a recommended 
	extension of .mdf
	
	
Secondary
	Optional user-defined data files. Can be spread across multiple disks with
	a recommended extension of .ndf.
	
	
Transaction Log
	holds infomation used to recover the database. Aleast one log     
	file must be
	created for each DB with a extension of .ldf.
